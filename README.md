# Open-Movie-Database-App
In order to make a simple design for this application, I was thinking of a way to dockerize the frontend and the backend in a single container.
Therefore, I decided to use NodeJS & ExpressJS to serve static files built with ReactJS.

# Frontend
- ReactJS(vite)

# Backend
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS

# Documentation
- Swagger (OpenAPI documentation)
